# EduApp 📚  
### An Inclusive Learning App for Blind & Deaf Students

EduApp is an **Android-based inclusive learning application** built using **Kotlin**, designed to make digital education accessible for **blind and deaf students**.

This project was created after working closely with **blind and deaf students at Anandwan, Warora**, where we observed real challenges students face while accessing standard digital learning tools. EduApp was built with an **accessibility-first mindset**.

## 🌱 Project Motivation

Most digital education platforms are not designed with accessibility as a priority.  
Blind and deaf students are often left out due to poor UI design and lack of assistive features.

**EduApp’s goal** was simple:

> Make learning accessible to students who are usually left out of digital education.
